Lengths are in metres for calculation but in pixels for graphical representation.
Different link lengths scale all values accordingly
therefore all of them behave similarly from the wave propagation perspective.
Every time-step in calculation corresponds to ONE SECOND in physics model. This normalises the time in formulae. 
Non-linear elasticity makes the system non-LTI and causes higher order harmonics.
