Link lengths are in metres for calculation but in pixels for graphical representation.
Different link lengths scale all values accordingly
therefore from wave propagation perspective all of them behave similarly.

Every time-step in calculation corresponds to ONE SECOND in physics model. This normalises the time in formulae.
To virtually make the system behave as it was sampled more frequently, I intruduced "virtual_sampling_timestep".
It is involved in the point position formulae.
Its values that are less than 1 will effectively slow down every motion.
If you think sampling frequency of 1 Hz isn't high enough, you can use this virtual parameter to slow down the system.

Be careful with non-linear elasticity. It makes the system non-LTI and causes higher order harmonics.
